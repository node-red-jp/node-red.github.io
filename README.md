### Previewing the Site
This site is a Github Pages site that uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for static site generation.  To preview and test the site, first, make sure [Jekyll is installed](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Fork the repository so you can make changes, commit them to your own repository and make pull requests for review.  Then clone the repository if you haven't already:

    git clone https://github.com/{your-github}/node-red.github.io

Then run jekyll:
    
    cd node-red.github.io
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve -w

Once the site is built and running you can preview it at [`http://127.0.0.1:4000/`](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).
